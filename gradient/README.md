# Simple Steppest descent and gradient problem

It requires `python >= 3.9` and `numpy`.

Execute using:
```shell
python3 gradients.py
```

The script implements simple Steppest descent algorithm as well as the
conjugate gradient.

TODOS:
- [ ] Benchmark against analytical solution
- [ ] Mesh convergence analysis
